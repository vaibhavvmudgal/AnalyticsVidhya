Writing Powerful Data Science Articles,/courses/writing-powerful-data-science-articles,"""Either write something worth reading or do something worth writing."" - Benjamin Franklin
The best way to learn any concept, especially in data science, is by writing about it. That not only helps you understand what you learned in more detail, but sharing it with the community helps others understand how a particular data science idea works.
But here’s the thing - most people want to write, but just can’t get past the initial challenges. This might sound familiar to a lot of people:

What should I write about?
Will anyone read my article?
How do I make my article stand out?
Should I even write?

Twitter Sentiment Analysis,/courses/twitter-sentiment-analysis,"What is Sentiment Analysis?

Sentiment Analysis or Opinion Mining is a technique used to analyse the emotion in a text. We can extract the attitude or the opinion of a piece of text and get insights on it. 
In the context of machine learning, you can think of Sentiment Analysis as a Classification problem where the text can either have a positive sentiment, a negative sentiment or a neutral one.


What are the applications of Sentiment Analysis in the industry?

In the age of social media, it is extremely common to comment about 
a movie you liked or 
a book you didn’t like or 
a product you bought was not up to the mark.


Therefore, a lot of companies use sentiment analysis for their products since it provides direct feedback of the customer’s opinion.
It is also important to detect and remove hateful content from social media and companies like Twitter, Facebook, etc. extensively use sentiment analysis on a daily basis.

 
On what kind of projects would I implement sentiment analysis?
There are a wide variety of projects where you can use Sentiment Analysis. Here are a couple of popular use cases:

Sentiment Analysis can not only be used for customer reviews or product feedback, but in other domains as well.
Analyzing the sentiments on social media on the US Elections, for example, gives useful insights on which candidates are favoured by the public and which are not.

For other interesting problems involving sentiment/emotion detection, you can visit: https://datahack.analyticsvidhya.com/contest/all/

What is the range of sentiments that can be observed and analysed?

In the earlier days of Natural language processing and Sentiment Analysis, the sentiments could hold only 2 or 3 values: Positive or Negative, and Positive, Neutral or Negative.
However, with the advent of deep learning, we can now recognize the subtle emotions in a text as well.
This has made tasks like Sarcasm detection, fake news detection etc. popular in research areas of Natural language processing

Swift is a more efficient, stable and secure programming language as compared to Python. In fact, Swift is also a good language to build for mobile. In fact, it’s the official language for developing iOS applications for the iPhone!
The cherry on the cake for Swift? It has the support of the likes of Google, Apple, and FastAI behind it!
“I always hope that when I start looking at a new language, there will be some mind-opening new ideas to find, and Swift definitely doesn’t disappoint. Swift tries to be expressive, flexible, concise, safe, easy to use, and fast. Most languages compromise significantly in at least one of these areas.” – Jeremy Howard
And when Jeremy Howard endorses a language and starts using it for his daily data science work, you need to drop everything and listen.
In this free course on Swift for Data Science, we will learn about Swift as a programming language and how it fits into the data science space. If you’re a Python user, you’ll notice the subtle differences and the incredible similarities between the two.

Introduction to Web Scraping using Python,/courses/introduction-to-web-scraping,"The need and importance of extracting data from the web is becoming increasingly loud and clear. There is an unprecedented volume of data on the internet right now - and data science projects often need this data to build predictive models.
That’s a key reason why data scientists are expected to be familiar with web scraping.
We have found web scraping to be a very helpful technique for gathering data from multiple websites. Some websites these days also provide APIs for many different types of data you might want to use, such as Tweets or LinkedIn posts.
But there might be occasions when you need to collect data from a website that does not provide a specific API. This is where having the ability to perform web scraping comes in handy. As a data scientist, you can code a simple Python script and extract the data you’re looking for.
So knowing how to perform web scraping using Python will help you go a long way towards becoming a resourceful data scientist. Are you ready to take the next step and dive in?
A note of caution here – web scraping is subject to a lot of guidelines and rules. Not every website allows the user to scrape content so there are certain legal restrictions at play. Always ensure you read the website’s terms and conditions on web scraping before you attempt to do it.
In this course, we will dive into the basics of web scraping using Python. We will understand what web scraping is, the different Python libraries for performing web scraping, and finally we’ll implement web scraping using Python in a real-world project. There’s a lot to unpack here so enroll today and start learning!","['What is Web Scraping?', 'Caution', 'Popular Libraries for Web Scraping', 'Components of Web Scraping', 'AI&ML Blackbelt Plus Program (Sponsored)', 'Problem Setup', 'Step 1: Crawl', 'Step 2: Parse and Transform', 'Step 3: Store the Data', 'Single Webpage Scraping', 'Multiple Webpage Scraping(BeautifulSoup and Regex)', 'Scrape Images in Python', 'Scarpe Data on Page Load']"
